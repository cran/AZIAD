The original data set is based on the work of Deb and Trivedi (1997) analyze data on 4406 individuals, aged 66 and over, who are covered
by Medicare, a public insurance program. Originally obtained from the US National Medical
Expenditure Survey (NMES) for 1987/88, the data are available from the data archive of
the Journal of Applied Econometrics at http://www.econ.queensu.ca/jae/1997-v12.3/deb-trivedi/.
In AZIAD package we work with the number of physicians office visits for the patients.Based on
the analysis of kstest.A and kstest.B and lrt.A the data belongs to zero-inflated beta negative binomial
or beta negative binomial hurdle model.
